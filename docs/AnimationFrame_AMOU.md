# AMOU animation frame format — VERIFIED ✅

`build/animationframe/{body:06}/{action:02}.bin` entries in
`AnimationFrame{1..6}.uop`. Magic = `AMOU` (actually only the first 3 bytes
`'A','M','O'` are checked — the 4th byte is read but ignored).

**Source of truth:** ported from UOReader 0.8.7 by Kons (decompiled from
the public Google Code Archive release). UOReader was the original tool
that decoded these frames and was itself a port of `KRFrameViewer`. The
algorithm here is byte-for-byte equivalent to UOReader's
`UOFrameBin.cs` + `UOFrame.cs`.

A working Python reference decoder is in
``tools/ec_research/scripts/amou_decode_verified.py``.
It produces correct sprites for human-male idle (body 400, action 0).

## File layout

```
0x00..0x27   header (40 B)
0x28         palette       at header.colour_offset (ALWAYS 0x28), colour_count × 4 B
varies       frame table   at header.frame_offset (= 0x28 + colour_count*4), frame_count × 16 B
varies..eof  pixel stream  (one slice per frame, indexed by frame.data_offset)
```

Verified across 4,355 sampled files: `colour_offset == 0x28` and
`frame_offset == colour_offset + colour_count*4` with no gap — the palette
starts immediately after the 40-byte header and the frame table immediately
after the palette.

## Header (40 B)

| Off  | Type   | Field           | Notes                                          |
|------|--------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00 | char[4]| magic           | `'AMOU'` — only first 3 bytes checked          |
| 0x04 | u32    | version         | 1 in all samples                               |
| 0x08 | u32    | total_size      | end of file / end of pixel stream              |
| 0x0C | u32    | body_id         |                                                |
| 0x10 | i16    | init_x          | global bbox top-left X                         |
| 0x12 | i16    | init_y          | global bbox top-left Y                         |
| 0x14 | i16    | end_x           | global bbox bottom-right X (exclusive)         |
| 0x16 | i16    | end_y           | global bbox bottom-right Y (exclusive)         |
| 0x18 | u32    | colour_count    | palette length in entries                      |
| 0x1C | u32    | colour_offset   | absolute file offset to palette                |
| 0x20 | u32    | frame_count     | REAL frame count                               |
| 0x24 | u32    | frame_offset    | absolute file offset to frame table            |

Bbox convention: width = `end_x - init_x`, height = `end_y - init_y`
(no `+1` — `end` is exclusive).

## Palette

Each entry = `(R, G, B, alpha_flag)`. 4th byte is body-specific marker
(special-color tag), not an alpha channel — render with `A = 255`.

## Frame table

`frame_count` × 16 B at `frame_offset`:

| Off   | Type   | Field           |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| +0x00 | u16    | id              |
| +0x02 | u16    | frame_index     |
| +0x04 | i16    | init_x          |
| +0x06 | i16    | init_y          |
| +0x08 | i16    | end_x           |
| +0x0A | i16    | end_y           |
| +0x0C | u32    | data_offset_rel | offset to pixel data, RELATIVE to this frame entry's start |

Pixel data for frame *i* begins at `frame_offset + i*16 + data_offset_rel`.
Pixel area starts at `frame_offset + frame_count * 16`.

The `id` field is the **action id** (matches the `{action}` in the filename);
`frame_index` is a flat `1..frame_count` counter that does **not** reset per
direction.

## Direction packing — VERIFIED ✅ (5 stored directions)

A single action file holds **all directions concatenated**, not one direction.
`frame_count` = `5 × framesPerDirection`: the frames are 5 equal contiguous
runs, one per stored UO facing direction, mirrored to 8 at draw time exactly
like CC anim.

Evidence: across 1,690 sampled action files, **1,689 have `frame_count`
divisible by 5** (the lone exception is a 49-frame file, likely truncated).
Counts are never uniformly divisible by 8 (125/1690) or 6 (157/1690). Observed
`frame_count` values: `10,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80` — all
multiples of 5. e.g. body 400/00 = 50 (5×10), body 106/00 = 55 (5×11).

To play `(action, dir, frame)`:
```
fpd   = frame_count / 5
sdir  = mirror8to5(dir)            # CC's standard 8→5 fold (mirror dirs 5..7)
slice = frames[sdir*fpd : sdir*fpd + fpd]
```

## Body-id coverage — VERIFIED ✅

`AnimationFrame{1..6}` together hold **34,836 entries covering body ids
0–1681 only** (790 distinct bodies at action 0; action ids span 0–78 with gaps
at 43–46 and 52–59). These are the real in-game mobile bodies — human (400/401),
horse (204/226), dragon (59), etc. all live here. **There are no high-id bodies
in AMOU**, and there is no separate HD-animation archive (Texture.uop is static
world art). See [AnimationDefinition.md](AnimationDefinition.md) for why the
high body ids in that registry are a *different, frame-less id space*.

## Pixel stream — anti-aliased RLE

Decode row-major across the frame's bbox. Each iteration reads opcode `b`:

```
b = stream[off++]
if b < 128:
    # transparent skip
    advance cursor by b pixels
else:
    n_solid = b - 128
    b2 = stream[off++]
    hi = b2 >> 4         # leading-edge AA weight (0..15)
    lo = b2 & 0x0F       # trailing-edge AA weight (0..15)

    if hi > 0:
        idx = stream[off++]
        # 1 anti-aliased pixel: blend palette[idx] with whatever is at
        # the cursor (i.e. background or a previously-written pixel) at
        # weight hi/16.
        write blend(palette[idx], prior, hi)
        advance 1 px

    for _ in range(n_solid):
        idx = stream[off++]
        write palette[idx]    # solid (alpha=255)
        advance 1 px

    if lo > 0:
        idx = stream[off++]
        write blend(palette[idx], prior, lo)
        advance 1 px
```

Blend math (UOReader's nibble blender, reduces to a 4-bit weighted lerp
per channel):

```
out_r = (idx_r * w + prior_r * (16 - w)) / 16
out_g = (idx_g * w + prior_g * (16 - w)) / 16
out_b = (idx_b * w + prior_b * (16 - w)) / 16
out_a = 255
```

Cursor advances left-to-right, wrapping to the next row at `width`.
Stream is consumed until `y >= height`.

## What was wrong in the prior research doc

Before recovering UOReader, the speculative layout had:

- "atlas_w / atlas_h" at 0x18 / 0x1C — these are actually
  `colour_count` (u32) and `colour_offset` (u32).
- "nominal_count" at 0x20 — actually the real `frame_count`. (For
  body 400 action 0: 50 entries, all valid.)
- "palette_byte_size" at 0x24 — actually `frame_offset`. The palette
  size = `colour_count * 4`.
- "8 bytes flags" at 0x28..0x2F — actually the last 4 bytes of that
  range (`frame_offset`) are part of the header; the prior bytes are
  `frame_count`.
- "frame table entry's u32 is cumulative end-offset" — actually it's a
  per-entry data offset relative to that entry's own start.
- "bbox uses inclusive max" — actually `end_x`/`end_y` are exclusive.
- Pixel stream was completely undecoded; format is anti-aliased RLE
  (this section above).

## Test fixtures

- Body 400 (human male), action 0 (idle) — `colour_count=256`,
  `frame_count=50`, total ~64 KB. Decoded sprites land at
  `dump_amou_decoded/frame_00_idx001.png` etc. — ~51% pixel coverage
  matches a humanoid figure.
- Located in `AnimationFrame1.uop` at
  `build/animationframe/000400/00.bin`.

## Live-engine integration findings (CUO port)

Below are post-port discoveries from wiring the decoder into ClassicUO
(see `src/ClassicUO.Renderer/Animations/EcAnimation.cs` and
`Animation.cs::TryBuildEcFrames`).

### Direction stride: 5 dirs × N frames (NOT 10 × N)

Empirically verified by playback: AMOU stores all directions
concatenated, with `frames.Length / 5` frames per direction. We tested
10 dirs × `frames.Length/10` first — it produced wrong facings on
playback. So the layout matches CC's `MAX_DIRECTIONS = 5` convention
(dirs 0..4 stored, mirrored to 5..7 at draw time).

For body 400 idle (50 frames): 10 frames per direction.

### Per-frame anchor must reference MAIN bbox

The per-frame `(InitX, InitY)` bbox shifts between frames as the body
animates (limbs moving, etc.). Anchoring each frame by its own
`InitX` causes visible **vibration** — the figure's pivot point jumps
between frames.

Per UOReader's `AnimationFrames.cs:258-262`, each frame's content is
blitted into a body-wide canvas of `MainBbox` dimensions at offset
`(frame.InitX - main.InitX, frame.InitY - main.InitY)`. Every frame
shares the same canvas size, so the body anchor stays stable across
frames. Our CUO port builds canvas-sized pixel buffers and uses CC's
`(CenterX, CenterY)` convention computed from the **main bbox**:

```
CenterX = mainCanvasW / 2
CenterY = 0                          (body's natural floor sits at canvas bottom)
mainCanvasW = mainEndX - mainInitX
mainCanvasH = mainEndY - mainInitY
```

### Anti-aliased edges: encode as partial alpha

UOReader's pixel decoder blends AA edge pixels against the *background
color of the preview canvas* (PaleGreen) — a preview-rendering trick.
When we ported that to render against the game world, edges came out
muddy because we were blending against transparent black.

Correct port: at decode time, for AA edge pixels (1..15 weight), keep
the palette RGB intact and **encode the weight as partial alpha**
(`alpha = w * 255 / 16`). The GPU composites them against the live
scene at draw time. Solid run pixels keep `alpha = 255`.

### Color: use SHADER_PARTIAL_HUED, not SHADER_NONE

The AMOU palette stores **neutral / greyscale skin tones**. The
character's body hue is applied at draw time via CC's
partial-hue shader (pixels where `R == G == B` get tinted, others
pass through). Bypassing the hue (`SHADER_NONE`) leaves the figure
washed-out grey. `SHADER_PARTIAL_HUED` matches CC's behavior and
produces correctly-skinned characters.

### Action numbering: AMOU uses HighAnimationGroup universally

This is the big one for non-human bodies.

CC's `GetGroupForAnimation` returns action IDs in **per-body-type
enums**: `PeopleAnimationGroup` for humans, `LowAnimationGroup` for
animals, `HighAnimationGroup` for monsters. So CC's "idle action"
is `People.Stand=4` for a human, `Low.Stand=2` for a cow,
`High.Stand=1` for a monster.

But AMOU files are stored per-body keyed by `{action:02}.bin` and
the action numbers inside the file **always follow
HighAnimationGroup numbering** regardless of the body's CC type.
So body 216 (cow) action 2 in AMOU is **Die1** (High.Die1 = 2),
not **Stand** (Low.Stand = 2).

#### Symptom

Cow plays the death animation when CC asks for idle — CC sends
action 2, AMOU interprets it as Die1.

#### Fix

In `TryBuildEcFrames`, translate the CC action number from the body's
effective group into High before the AMOU file lookup. Translation
table for Low → High:

| CC `LowAnimationGroup` action | AMOU action (High) |
|---|---|
| 0  Walk    | 0  Walk          |
| 1  Run     | 0  Walk          |
| 2  Stand   | 1  Stand         |
| 3  Eat     | 7  Misc1         |
| 5  Attack1 | 4  Attack1       |
| 6  Attack2 | 5  Attack2       |
| 7  Attack3 | 6  Attack3       |
| 8  Die1    | 2  Die1          |
| 9  Fidget1 | 17 Fidget1       |
| 10 Fidget2 | 18 Fidget2       |
| 11 LieDown | 14 Misc4         |
| 12 Die2    | 3  Die2          |

Verified visually for cow (body 216): AMOU `01.bin` = standing cow,
`02.bin` = collapsing cow (death). My remap of CC's Low.Stand(2) →
AMOU action 1 lands on idle, fixing the death-when-standing bug.

#### Don't over-remap: respect the `CalculateOffsetLowGroupExtended` flag

Some `Animal`-typed bodies have the `CalculateOffsetLowGroupExtended`
flag (0x20 in `mobtypes.txt`). With that flag, CC switches the
body's effective group from Low to **High** (or People, if combined
with `CalculateOffsetByPeopleGroup`). These bodies pass High-group
action numbers from CC already, so re-applying the Low → High remap
would **double-translate**.

In our CC install (`mobtypes.txt`), 21 Animal bodies have this flag:
`5, 6, 23, 25, 27, 29, 34, 37, 52, 63, 64, 65, 81, 88, 97, 98, 99,
100, 127, 133, 134`. Visually identified: eagles (5), small birds
(6), bats (29), various dragons / wyverns (97, 127, 134), and a mix
of cats / quadrupeds. The shared trait: they animate with monster-
style action sets (Walk + Stand replaced by Fly etc.).

Our port checks `AnimationFlags.CalculateOffsetLowGroupExtended` and
skips the Low → High remap when set (unless `ByLowGroup` is also
set, which keeps the body in Low).

### RESOLVED ❌→✅: the "0x28 mystery field" was a doc error

There is **no mystery field at 0x28** — and the format has no per-action
timing field at all. `colour_offset` is uniformly `0x28` (verified over 4,355
files), so the bytes at `0x28..0x2B` are simply **palette entry [0]** (the
darkest `R,G,B,flag`), and `0x2C..0x2F` is palette entry [1].

The earlier "idle `03 02 03` = slow / run `0b 0b 0b` = fast" pattern was
coincidence: palette[0] is each file's darkest shade (a near-black shadow
colour), and it varies per action only because every action file carries its
own palette. It does not encode timing or directions.

**Implication:** AMOU stores no playback speed. EC bodies in the AMOU id space
(0–1681) animate at the engine's standard rate — use CC's fixed frame delay,
which is what ClassicUO already does. (The per-body `interval` float in
[AnimationDefinition.md](AnimationDefinition.md) only applies to the disjoint
high-id space, which has no frames anyway.)

## Human body 400 action labels — verified visually

CUO's `PeopleAnimationGroup` enum stops at index 34 (`AnimationCount = 35`),
but human body 400 has AMOU files for actions **0–42 and 47–51**. The extra
actions are EC-specific extensions never exposed by CC, and the CUO labels
for the first 35 don't always match what AMOU actually contains for that
slot. Identified by dumping `body400_action{NN}_f{0..9}.png` (dir 0) and
visually inspecting:

| Action | CUO label                  | Visual content (AMOU body 400)        |
|-------:|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|  4     | Stand                      | unused / mismatched — not real idle   |
|  5     | Fidget1                    | fidgeting (1)                         |
|  6     | Fidget2                    | fidgeting (2)                         |
|  7/8   | StandOneHand/TwoHand       | armed standing                        |
| 21     | Die1                       | death ✓                               |
| **35** | —                          | running with dual-hand long pole      |
| **36** | —                          | dual-hand long pole standing          |
| **37** | —                          | **true idle / neutral breathing pose** — what real EC plays |
| **38** | —                          | sit idle                              |
| **39** | —                          | receiving a blow                      |
| **40** | —                          | martial-arts blow deflection sideways |
| **41** | —                          | war-mode fidgeting (standing)         |
| **42** | —                          | sit fidget                            |
| **47** | —                          | mounted idle                          |
| **48** | —                          | mounted blow                          |
| **49** | —                          | mounted pointing up (celebration?)    |
| **50** | —                          | mounted fidget                        |
| **51** | —                          | mounted drinking/eating               |

Actions 43–46 are absent from the AMOU archive.

**Implication for porting**: CC asks for People.Stand=4 for idle, but
AMOU body 400 action 04 does NOT hold EC's actual idle pose — that's at
action 37. When EC anim is enabled, remap People.Stand → 37 before the
AMOU file lookup. (See `MobileAnimation.GetGroupForAnimation` in CUO.)

## UOReader provenance

UOReader 0.8.7 (2013) by Kons — released on the Mythic-era Ultima Online
fan community. Source is on the Google Code Archive:
`https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/kprojects/UOReader_0.8.7.zip`.
The animation viewer there is described as ported from `KRFrameViewer`,
made by Kons and Wim during the Kingdom Reborn era — so this format has
been continuous from KR through EC.

## CORRECTION — palette 4th byte is the HUE-MASK flag (verified in-client)

Earlier this doc called the 4th palette byte a "special-color tag" and
recommended drawing with `SHADER_PARTIAL_HUED`. **Both are wrong** — verified
against the EC binary (UOSA.exe), the decoded frames, and live ClassicUO
rendering.

### The flag is the EC hue mask — and which channel is which
The 4th byte of each `(R,G,B,flag)` palette entry is the **hue mask**. The
crucial part (proven by rendering body 400 over grass and looking — see
`amou_400_frames.png`): **the greyscale ramp is the SKIN/body, the colour ramp
is the dyeable cloth.**

| flag | body 400 count | what it is | colours |
|------|----------------|------------|---------|
| `0`  | 173 / 256 | **SKIN / body** — drawn neutral greyscale, tinted by the mobile (skin) hue, exactly like CC's greyscale body art | grey ramp, dark→white: (172,170,165), (242,242,242) |
| `1`  | 83 / 256 | **dyeable cloth** (the loincloth on 400) — carries a baked default colour, re-tinted per dye | warm tan ramp: (93,89,80), (121,109,101) |

So flag=0 is **not** "fixed white highlights" — those greys are the body, and
the bright entries are skin *highlight* shading. If you draw the body without
tinting, that highlight shading reads as moving white speckles on the skin.

The EC client (pixel shaders `UOSprite.psh` / `UOSpriteUI.psh`, funcs
`FUN_00594c10` / `FUN_00595a40`) hues sprites with **three samplers**:
`SpriteSampler` (the frame), `HueSampler` (the hue ramp texture from
`Hues.uop`, see `Hues.md`), and `HueMaskSampler` (`HAS_HUEMASK_TEX`). Masked
pixels are lerped with `HueSampler[hueIndex][pixel.intensity]`; unmasked pixels
pass through. This is the **same mask-based scheme the static HD art uses**.

### How ClassicUO renders it (reuse of CC partial-hue)
EC's hue set == CC `hues.mul` (see `Hues.md`), so we reuse CUO's existing
partial-hue shader, which ramps pixels where `R==G==B`. The decoder bakes the
mask into the palette to line up with that test:

- **flag=0 (skin)** → collapse to exact luminance (`R==G==B`) so partial-hue
  ramps it to flesh by the mobile's skin hue. At hue 0 it shows neutral
  greyscale — exactly like CC's hue-0 body. The skin-highlight pixels tint
  along with the rest of the body, so the white-speckle artefact disappears.
- **flag!=0 (cloth)** → keep the baked colour, and break any exact grey
  (`r++`/`r--`) so partial-hue leaves it untouched.

`MobileView` then forces `GetHueVector(hue, partial:true, …)` for EC anim.
Pixel AA: render every emitted pixel **opaque** (CC-style hard edge) — the AMOU
coverage bytes were authored to blend over EC's black preview canvas, so using
them as live alpha over the world washes edges to grey. The downscale keeps a
half-coverage cutoff to opaque, no partial alpha survives.

> Earlier mistakes worth not repeating: (a) drawing the baked palette with
> `SHADER_NONE` shows the body as raw greyscale (white speckles); (b)
> greyscaling **flag!=0** instead of flag=0 tints the loincloth and leaves the
> skin grey — the flag was inverted.

## Scale — AMOU is KR-HD pitch (~1.5× CC)
AMOU frames are larger than CC: body 400 canvas is **46×78** (content ~30×64)
vs a CC human ~50px tall, so drawn at scale 1 the character is oversized.
Downscale at decode to CC pitch. `2/3` (the static HD→CC constant) overshoots
(too small); **~0.85** matches. Single constant `EcAnimation.ANIM_SCALE`.

## Border — AMOU has none; CC's is a *subtle baked edge*, not a ring
CC anim art has a soft dark edge baked into the sprite (darker edge pixels),
NOT a hard black outline. AMOU edge pixels are the `hi`/`lo` AA-coverage entries;
we render them opaque (see above), which already gives a defined edge. Adding a
solid 1px black ring looks wrong — a faithful match would be a subtle
*edge-darken* of the existing edge pixels (TODO, low priority).
